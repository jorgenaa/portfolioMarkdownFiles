###  Hello I'm Jørgen
I'm a Front-End passionated developer from Norway with an eye for detail and have passion for technology.

I completed my professional degree in Fornt-end development at Noroff in 2021, and have since then worked on a fullstack project for my own business as a ecommerce website owner. Currently I am working on renewing the website to a better solution based on framework like Remix, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Tailwind.

I like to stay up to date and always learn something new while maintaining the focus on user experience and user interface. I design interactive products today using primarily Liquid, Remix, React.js, Next.js, Typescript, Redux, Git, Sass, Tailwind, BEM and Adobe Illuastrstor / Photoshop / XD / Figma and I am also open to learn other technologies as needed.

So far I have acquired powerfull skills for building appealing and responsive websites that meets the today's criteria. To see some examples of what I have worked with lately, check out some of my projects in the portfolio section.
